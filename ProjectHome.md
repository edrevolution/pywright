# PyWright #
This program was created to enable fans to produce their own fan cases based on the Phoenix Wright series of games. It consists of an engine to run the games. Games themselves are scripted in "wrightscript", and several of them can be downloaded from within the program itself.

# Features #
  * Fully functional scripting language based on a mishmash of basic and python
  * Animated sprites and text with sophisticated dialog engine
  * Music, sound effects, other special effects
  * Customizable
  * Multiple saved games
  * Works identically on Windows, Mac, and Linux
  * Stay up to date by downloading engine patches and supported games from the engine itself
  * Multiple display options

# History #
This project was started in 2007 as a personal project. After showing it to other Phoenix Wright fans on http://forums.court-records.net/, it has grown and evolved through their feedback. It is the dedicated members there who have actually made the games that are available.

# Help Wanted #
Python programmers to help with features and bugs, anyone to help with documentation.
