#someguidelines for what kinds of documentation we need

Users are going to be at different levels:

  * Newbie - what can I do, how do I get started
  * Familiar - I know how to do x, but how do I do y?
  * Proficient - I forget what that command was called...

The newbie is best served with tutorials and demos, the familiar is best served with how-to's or subject based documentation, and the proficient is best served with an api. Also, troubleshooting, i.e., this weird thing is going on, how can I fix it? is useful for all skill levels.
